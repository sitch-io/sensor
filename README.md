## Getting Started

## Prerequisites

* Accounts with the following providers:
  * Balena.io
  * Github
* Access to the following services (See Service configuration for more
  information)
  * Logstash
  * Vault
  * SITCH feed.  See https://github.com/sitch-io/feed_builder for more
  information.
* Hardware
  * Raspberry Pi 3
  * Simcom (SIM808 | SIM800L | SIM900) GSM modem with SIM
  * USB TTY cable (for GSM modem)
  * RTL-SDR device.  Tested with NooElec NESDR Mini and NooElec NESDR XTR
  * GlobalSat USB GPS dongle (any gpsd-compatible USB GPS shold work)

## Step by step...

1. Create an application in Balena.
1. Fork this project and clone it on your workstation.  Or clone it directly...
but forking makes modifications and PRs easier to deal with.
1. Add the Balena application as a remote repo (`git remote add balena myusername@git.balena.io/myusername/myapplicationname.git`)
1. Push to your Balena application: `git push balena master`

We expect (at least) the following environment variables to be set in Balena:


| Variable              | Purpose                                                 |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| LOCATION_NAME         | Override the default device name (Balena UUID)           |
| LOG_HOST              |  hostname:port                                          |
| STATE_LIST            | List of states (in caps) for FCC feed.  ex: "CA,TX"     |
| VAULT_PATH            | Path to logstash cert/keys in Vault                     |
| VAULT_TOKEN           | Token for accessing credentials in vault                |
| VAULT_URL             | URL for accessing Vault. ex: https://v.example.com:port |

For more configuration options, consult the
[environment variables](http://sensor.readthedocs.io/en/latest/environment_variables.html)
section of the [documentation](http://sensor.readthedocs.io).


## Testing

Testing is done with pytest.  Coverage module optional.

Testing requirements (local testing possible only on Linux):
* lshw
* pip packages: pytest-cov pytest-pep8 pyserial hvac kalibrate
python-geoip python-geoip-geolite2 pyudev gps3 geopy python-dateutil


1. Navigate to the base directory of the repository.
1. Set the environment variable to reach your SITCH feed:
`export SITCH_FEED_BASE=https://MY.FEED.URL/base`
1. Run `py.test --cov sitchlib` .

* OR, offer a PR and let travis-ci build and run the tests for you.

## GSM modem device detection

If you're using a GSM modem that's not recognized by the device detector,
please add the output from running the `ATI` command against your GSM modem in
the variable named `positive_match` in the `is_a_gsm_modem()` method, in the
`sensor/sitch/sitchlib/device_detector.py` file.  Then send a pull request so
that everyone can get the benefit of your discovery.

## Included binaries

This repository contains pre-built binaries for Filebeat and Kalibrate.  The
licenses which apply to these two tools can be found
[here](./filebeat-license.txt) and [here](./kalibrate-license.txt), respectively.

Building the Docker container will cause the retrieval of the MaxMind GeoLite2
database...

This tool includes the geoipupdate tool created by MaxMind, also available
[here](https://github.com/maxmind/geoipupdate)

## Contributing

* Please do PRs against the `test` branch.
* To add an ID string to the device detector for GSM modems, add part of the
ID string to the ```positive_match``` variable in the
```DeviceDetector.is_a_gsm_modem()``` function
