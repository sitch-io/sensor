        The first time we get a geo event, we set the state and print a message

            against the geo_anchor.  Once the anchor is set, it does not
            change for the life of the instance.  Correlation of subsequent
            events causes the distance beween the anchor and current event
            to be determined and if the threshold of 10km is exceeded, an alert
            is returned.

                events coming through this method.  Position 1 is expected to
                contain geo json.
